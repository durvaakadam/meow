    "mating the entire workflow and limiting human involvement, it reduces the risk of fraud. ● The web portal based system provides accurate records, as well as real-time access to all information. Problem Statement To address the inefficiencies of the traditional Public Distribution System (PDS), this project introduces a secure and automated solution that overcomes challenges such as unreliable authentication, long wait times, and human errors. It focuses on ensuring transparency, real-time monitoring, and efficient inventory management to prevent unverified distribution, reduce wastage, and ensure that eligible beneficiaries receive their rightful entitlements. Objectives • To increase efficiency by reducing wait times through automation of the ration dispensing process. • To enhance accuracy in ration distribution by eliminating manual errors using precise electronic weighing and dispensing mechanisms. • To improve user experience through a user-friendly interface for secure authentica",
    "tion and seamless transaction management. • To promote transparency by displaying real-time weight measurements on an LED monitor and maintaining a visible log of transactions. • To enable real-time monitoring and alerts using Blynk for instant notifications and Firebase Realtime Database for cloud-based data visualization and analysis. • To reduce wastage and optimize inventory using predictive analytics and real-time tracking of inventory levels.
