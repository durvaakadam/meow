Introduction\nThe Meta Quest 3, also known simply as “Quest 3,” was announced in June 2023 and\nofficially released in October 2023 by Reality Labs, a division of Meta Platforms. It\nrepresents Meta’s continued investment in virtual and mixed reality technologies and is the\nsuccessor to the popular Quest 2 headset.\nThe Quest 3 is the third-generation standalone VR headset in the Meta Quest series. It\nmerges the accessibility and affordability of the Quest 2 with advanced features from the\npremium Quest Pro, such as pancake lenses and full-color mixed-reality passthr",
    "ough.\nThese upgrades make the Quest 3 a powerful and compact device positioned as Meta’s\nflagship mixed-reality (MR) headset for mainstream users.\nThe headset primarily targets consumers and gamers, offering immersive VR and MR\nexperiences without requiring a PC or external sensors. Beyond entertainment, it is also\nbeing adopted in education, enterprise training, and fitness applications due to its\nstandalone functionality, ease of setup, and strong developer ecosystem supported by\nMeta’s software tools.\n2. Hardware Specifications\nSpecification Details\nDisplay Type Dual LCD panels with Meta’s Infinite Display optical stack using\n2-element pancake lenses. Marketed as “4K+ Infinite Display.”\nResolution 2064 × 2208 pixels per eye\nRefresh Rate Supports 72 Hz, 90 Hz, and 120 Hz refresh rates\nField of View (FOV) Approximate 110° horizontal FOV.\nProcessor (SoC) Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2, upgraded from XR2 Gen 1 (Quest\n2) . It offers significantly higher GPU and overall performance.\nGPU In",
    "tegrated Adreno GPU (part of XR2 Gen 2 SoC). It provides about 2×\ngraphics performance compared to XR2 Gen 1.\nRAM & Storage 8 GB RAM available in 128 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB storage variants .\nSensors Inside-out optical tracking with multiple outward cameras , IMU\n(accelerometer + gyroscope) , RGB color passthrough cameras for MR.\nIR cameras for controller tracking, supports eye-tracking via\nSDK/firmware (hardware eye-tracking present mainly in higher-end\nmodels).\n3. Input and Interaction Devices\nControllers: Touch Plus controllers (tracked, ergonomic, with buttons, thumbsticks, and\nadvanced haptics). They are tracked by the headset’s inside-out optical system .\nHand tracking / gesture input: Native hand tracking supported (controller-less interactions\nare available for many experiences).\nVoice / eye control: Voice commands supported for system-level actions; eye-tracking\ncapabilities are being expanded in Meta’s platform and developer SDKs (Quest 3 supports\nMR features that can use gaz",

Use of eye data is\nexposed via SDKs where available.\nMotion tracking tech: Inside-out tracking only i.e the headset uses outward-facing\ncameras for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and controller tracking (no\nexternal lighthouse/base stations).\n4. Audio System\nSpeakers: Built-in spatial audio speakers (on-headset open-ear speakers) and standard\n3.5 mm / USB-C options for external headphones.\nNoise cancellation: There is no active noise cancellation like in ANC headphones; the\nheadset uses on-board speakers and passive isolation from the facial interface external\nheadphones are recommended when isolation/ANC is required.\n3D / spatial audio: The system provides spatialized audio that follows head orientation and\nin-world object positions, which significantly enhances immersion for games and MR\nexperiences (developers can use spatial audio APIs).\n5. Display and Optics\nThe Meta Quest 3 features a 4K+ Infinite Display with a resolution of",
    " 2064 × 2208 pixels\nper eye and advanced pancake lenses that enhance visual clarity while reducing headset\nthickness. It supports refresh rates of 72 Hz, 90 Hz, and 120 Hz, offering a 110° horizontal\nand 96° vertical field of view. Overall, it delivers a 30% resolution increase and 25% sharper\nimage quality compared to the Quest 2.\n● Display:\n○ Resolution: 2064 × 2208 pixels per eye (4K+ Infinite Display)\n○ Pixels per inch (PPI): 1,218\n○ Pixels per degree (PPD): 25\n● Optics:\n○ Lens Type: Pancake lens\n○ Visual Clarity: 25% sharper center field view than Quest 2\n○ Stray Light: Reduced glare and scattered light artifacts\n○ Slimmer Profile: 40% thinner optic design than Quest 2\n● Field of View (FOV):\n○ Horizontal: 110°\n○ Vertical: 96°\n● Refresh Rate:\n○ Supported Modes: 72 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz\n7. Software Ecosystem and Developer Tools\nOS & Platforms: Runs Meta Horizon OS based on Android AOSP. Supports native Quest\napps and compatible Android apps.\nSDKs / APIs: Developers can use Meta XR SDK a",
    "nd Horizon OS SDK with Unity, Unreal\nEngine, or OpenXR. Mixed-reality features are available via device SDKs such as v57+ for\nQuest 3.\nDeveloper Mode & Store: Developer mode allows testing and sideloading of apps. Apps\ncan be published on the Meta Quest Store or App Lab. The Meta XR Simulator enables\ndevelopment without the headset.\nApp Development & Deployment: Developers create apps in Unity or Unreal, integrate\nMeta XR or OpenXR plugins, test using the simulator or via Link/Air Link, build the APK,\nand deploy to the headset or submit to the Quest Store. MR passthrough APIs enable\nmixed-reality content.\n8. Applications and Use Cases\n● Gaming: Used for immersive VR and MR gaming with titles like Beat Saber, Asgard’s\nWrath 2, and Superhot VR. Supports PC VR games via Meta Link.\n● Education & Training: Helps in medical, engineering, and military simulations, offering\ninteractive learning through apps like Wander and Prisms VR.\n● Enterprise Collaboration: Enables virtual meetings and tea",
